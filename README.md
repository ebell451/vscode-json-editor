# JSON Tree Editor

A vscode extension to preview and edit JSON documents in a simple tree view, based on <https://jsoneditoronline.org>.

##

To start open the command pallete and type `json`.
`View>Command Palette> JSON Tree Editor: Start JSON editor session`

When a JSON file is opened in a standard vscode editor, you'll also find a `{}` icon in the right part of the editor's
top title bar to directly open JSON Tree Editor.

You can also make a right click upon a JSON file in the tree explorer, where you'll find a
**Start JSON Tree Editor session** item that will open both standard editor and JSON Tree Editor side by side.
